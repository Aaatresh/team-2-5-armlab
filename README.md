## ROB-550, Team 5

This repository is the code base of the ArmLab project in the ROB-550 course. At a high level, running this code base allows a 5 DOF robotic manipulator and a RealSense RGBD camera to detect pose and color of blocks of interest, and perform a pick-and-place task corresponding to it.
