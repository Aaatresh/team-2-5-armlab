# ROB-550: ArmLab, Team 5

## Description
This repository is the code base of the ArmLab project in the ROB-550 course. At a high level, running this code base allows a 5 DOF robotic manipulator and a RealSense RGBD camera to detect pose and color of blocks of interest, and perform a range of pick-and-place tasks. 

## Getting Started

### Dependencies
* Python 2.7
* ROS Melodic
* NumPy==1.15.0
* PyQt4


### Installing
```
  git clone git@github.com:Aaatresh/team-2-5-armlab.git
```

### Executing the code

```
# [in BASH]
./launch_armlab.sh
./control_station 
```
Clicking the buttons in the GUI that pops up after running the last command will execute various tasks that were detailed in the course.
